## Project Name & Pitch Transformative Justice Practitioner MapBase

#### Synopsis
* Name of Project:
    * Transformative Justice Practitioner MapBase

* Explain Premise of Application:  
    * The premise of this application is to create a visual network of Practitioners across the United States showcased via a map interface and being able to click on the marker that the person has to find their information. In turn, this will allow the user to be able to reach out to a trained & mentored Practitioner for assistance in conflict resolution.

## Reflection
* Context: 
    * I am a Global Restorative and Transformative Justice Practitioner as well as an instructor in my daily work. The folks involved  are from a small cohort that I currently teach outside of class time for almost a year, as the test base.

<!-- * Set out to build  -->

* Project Challenges:
    * I think a challenge for me was the map component because it takes time to implement, however, the payoff and knowledge will be worth it!

<!-- * Unexpected Obstacles   -->

* What tools re: implementation  HTML, CSS, JS, APIs
